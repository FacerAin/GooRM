This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Vision API. `Google Cloud Vision API`_ allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.

- See the `migration guide`_ for information about migrating to Python client library v0.25.1.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

This sample requires you to have authentication setup. Refer to the
`Authentication Getting Started Guide`_ for instructions on setting up
credentials for applications.

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Clone python-docs-samples and change directory to the sample directory you want to use.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples.git

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them. You may want to refer to the `Python Development Environment Setup Guide`_ for Google Cloud Platform for instructions.

   .. _Python Development Environment Setup Guide:
       https://cloud.google.com/python/setup

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python detect.py

    usage: detect.py [-h]
                     {faces,faces-uri,labels,labels-uri,landmarks,landmarks-uri,text,text-uri,logos,logos-uri,safe-search,safe-search-uri,properties,properties-uri,web,web-uri,web-geo,web-geo-uri,crophints,crophints-uri,document,document-uri,ocr-uri}
                     ...

    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations with the
    Google Cloud Vision API.

    Example Usage:
    python detect.py text ./resources/wakeupcat.jpg
    python detect.py labels ./resources/landmark.jpg
    python detect.py web ./resources/landmark.jpg
    python detect.py web-uri http://wheresgus.com/dog.JPG
    python detect.py web-geo ./resources/city.jpg
    python detect.py faces-uri gs://your-bucket/file.jpg
    python detect_pdf.py ocr-uri gs://python-docs-samples-tests/HodgeConj.pdf gs://BUCKET_NAME/PREFIX/
